  <h1>How I interpreted the story</h1>

  <p> THroughout the story, forking paths, are mentioned, and it is also mentioned how they sometimes reconvene, or may never come in contact again, Sort of like a giant web. I understand how this can be related to html, but I find it hard to believe that it inspired html. This is a good metaphor for the infinite number of links on the web, but doesn't strike me as the type of text to inspire this idea all-together. The idea of the book reminded me a lot fo a game called "wikitag." In this game both participants start on a randomly selected wikipedia page, and must navigate to a specific other page only by clicking hyperlinks. effectively clicking links until they finally find the link they want. demonstrating how vastly different paths may cross.
